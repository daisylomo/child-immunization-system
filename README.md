# TotoBora: A Web-Based Child Immunization and Growth Monitoring System for Improving Continuity of Care in Resource-Constrained Healthcare Facilities

## Problem Statement

Many healthcare facilities in resource-constrained environments still rely on paper-based systems for pediatric health records. This often results in:

- Misplaced or incomplete records
- Missed immunization schedules
- Poor growth monitoring
- Delayed medical interventions
- Weak continuity of care

TotoBora addresses these challenges by digitizing child healthcare records into a centralized and accessible system.

## Usage Instructions
### Administrator
1. Log in to the system.
2. Manage healthcare worker accounts.
3. Configure system settings where applicable.
4. Monitor registered children, appointments, and reports.
5. Manage role-based access permissions.

### Healthcare Worker
1. Log in using authorized credentials.
2. Register a child and enter guardian details.
3. Record administered vaccines.
4. Add height and weight measurements.
5. Generate immunization and growth reports.
6. Trigger or manage SMS reminders where applicable.

### Caregiver / Parent
Caregivers do not directly manage the system. They receive SMS reminders for:
> Upcoming vaccination appointments
> Missed immunization appointments

## API Documentation

TotoBora is primarily a web-based Laravel application. However, it uses an external API integration through Africa’s Talking for SMS notifications.

Provider: Africa’s Talking
Purpose: Sending SMS notifications to caregivers
Authentication: API Key
Usage: Appointment reminders and missed vaccination alerts
SMS Reminder Use Cases

The Africa’s Talking SMS API is used when:
> A child has an upcoming vaccination appointment
> A child has missed a scheduled immunization visit

---

## Scope

TotoBora focuses on:

✅ Child immunization tracking  
✅ Growth monitoring

## Authentication Flow


TotoBora uses session-based authentication built on Laravel's authentication 
system. Access is restricted to administrators and healthcare workers only. 
Caregivers do not log in - they interact with the system through SMS reminders.


### Entry and login


Every protected route is guarded by Laravel's `auth` middleware. Any 
unauthenticated request is redirected to `/login` regardless of the URL 
attempted.


On login, the system first checks rate limiting - a maximum of five attempts 
per IP address per minute. Exceeding this blocks further attempts temporarily. 
Within the limit, credentials are verified against the `users` table. 
Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes and are never stored or compared as 
plain text. Failed attempts return a generic error message that does not 
reveal whether the email or password was wrong.


After correct credentials are verified, the system checks that the account's 
`is_active` status is `true`. Deactivated accounts are rejected even with 
valid credentials. On success, the session ID is regenerated to prevent 
session fixation, and the rate limiter is cleared.


### Role-based redirection


After login, users are redirected based on their role:


* **Admin**

  * **Redirected to:** `/reports`
  * **Access:** Can access all facilities, all records, and manage users.

* **Healthcare Worker**

  * **Redirected to:** `/children`
  * **Access:** Can only access records for their assigned facility.



This is enforced on every request via the `EnsureRole` middleware — not just 
at the point of login. A healthcare worker navigating directly to `/reports` 
or `/users` receives a `403 Forbidden` response.


### Session and CSRF protection


Sessions are stored server-side. Only an encrypted session ID travels to the 
browser via an HTTP-only cookie. All forms include a `@csrf` token that 
Laravel validates on every state-changing request, blocking cross-site 
request forgery.


### Logout


Logout calls `Auth::logout()`, invalidates the session, and regenerates the 
CSRF token. The browser back button does not restore access after logout.


### Password reset


Users request a reset via the *Forgot password?* link on the login page. 
The system generates a random 64-character token, stores it hashed in 
`password_reset_tokens`, and it expires after 60 minutes. On submission, 
the token is verified and checked for expiry. If valid, the password is 
updated with a new bcrypt hash and the token is deleted, making it 
single-use.


### Account creation


Accounts are not self-registered. Only an administrator can create user 
accounts through `/users/create`, assigning the role, facility, and initial 
password. This reflects the system's design - healthcare workers are 
provisioned staff, not self-signing members of the public.
